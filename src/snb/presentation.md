# Why?

![costs](images/programming_costs.png)

Notes:

- Cognitive work.
- Mixture between theory, research and programming. What are the origins of programming
  failure?
- Ranked by costs.
- Data Science is about the misconception layer (deep learning, RL).

# Questions

- In our trading environment, can other parties detect and exploit our actions?
- Can we benchmark ourselves in our trading?
- How do we measure trading efficiency in central banks?

Notes:

- Why this question? Because it is the only thing I remember from my
  discussion with Mrs. Stahel.

# Plan

> Design is taking things apart in order to be able to put them back

>
> You want to design like Bartok. (...) [You] want to communicate very well (...)
> [and] work at multiple levels.
>
> And you want to [work] like Coltrane. You want to take preparedness and
> experience, real experience with doing things.

Notes:

- Rich Hickey (Design, Composition and Performance)
- Problem: we want to be as efficient as possible for trading, but then we also
  need to prove we are efficient. We have the burden of proof.
- Participants: multiple units involved if set to production?
- Known from unknown: time efficiency, robustness of methods, methods quality,
  data availability.
- Data quality: are the data timestamp disentangled from their release?
- Alternatives: econometrics and statistical methodologies could yield as
  powerful results.

# Benefits, Costs and Feasibility

- Extension of knowledge and methodology, used by a growing number of market
  participants.
- High risks and expensive: the fields are still at their infancy.
- Data are probably available in the SNB/BIS databases.
- Time to first results depends on the data, scope and infrastructure.
  (Ambitious goals could be topics for PhD).

Notes:

- Biggest fixed cost: data manipulation and efficient data pipeline.
- Strategy: define a protocol, select a methodology and analyze it.
- Refocus the discussion from the methods to the principles and properties.

# Risks and Hedging

- Sizable technical complexity, with a simple architecture of isolated
  components.
- Possible total failure from the methodology applied on the domain side,
  hedged with reusable technical artifacts which could solve daily operational
  business problems.
- Likelihood of success: How do you define success?

Notes:

- Finance is a cruel world, only results matters.
- But should this be the case for research projects? What about negative
  results? Fixed vs growth mindset?
- Are the gain in agility, efficiency and transparency be dismissed because the
  destination is not where we thought we would go?
